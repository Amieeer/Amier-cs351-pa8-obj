% Program C
define Point = class
    field x
    field y

    method init = proc(xVal, yVal) {
        set x = xVal;
        set y = yVal;
        this  % Why return this?
    }

    method moveTo = proc(newX, newY) {
        set x = newX;
        set y = newY;
        this  % Again, why?
    }

    method getX = proc() x
    method getY = proc() y
end

% Compare these two approaches:
define p1 = new Point
.<p1>init(3, 4)

define p2 = .<new Point>init(5, 6)
